# duck-read-cache-fs

A DuckDB extension for remote filesystem access cache.

## Loading cache httpfs
Since DuckDB v1.0.0, cache httpfs can be loaded as a community extension without requiring the `unsigned` flag. From any DuckDB instance, the following two commands will allow you to install and load the extension:
```sql
INSTALL cache_httpfs from community;
-- Or upgrade to latest version with `FORCE INSTALL cache_httpfs from community;`
LOAD cache_httpfs;
```
See the [cache httpfs community extension page](https://community-extensions.duckdb.org/extensions/cache_httpfs.html) for more information.

## Introduction

This repository is made as read-only filesystem for remote access, which serves as cache layer above duckdb [httpfs](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-httpfs).

Key features:
- Caching for data, which adds support for remote file access to improve IO performance and reduce egress cost; several caching options and entities are supported
  + in-memory, cache fetched file content into blocks and leverages a LRU cache to evict stale blocks
    - set `cache_httpfs_in_mem_cache_eviction_policy='w_tinylfu'` for W-TinyLFU eviction, which only admits a new block when it's accessed more frequently than the block it would evict, so a large one-pass scan doesn't flush hot blocks
  + on-disk (default), already read blocks are stored to load filesystem, and evicted on insufficient disk space based on their access timestamp
  + no cache, it's allowed to disable cache and fallback to httpfs without any side effects
- Parallel read, read operations are split into size-tunable chunks to increase cache hit rate and improve performance
- Apart from data blocks, the extension also supports cache file handle, file metadata and glob operation
  + The cache for these entities are enabled by default.
- Profiling helps us to understand system better, key metrics measured include cache access stats, and IO operation latency, we plan to support multiple types of profile result access; as of now there're three types of profiling
  + temp, all access stats are stored in memory, which could be retrieved via `SELECT cache_httpfs_get_profile();`
  + duckdb (under work), stats are stored in duckdb so we could leverage its rich feature for analysis purpose (i.e. use histogram to understant latency distribution)
  + profiling is by default disabled
- Cache status query functions provide visibility into cache state and access:
  + `cache_httpfs_cache_status_query()` - Returns information about all cached entries including cache filepath, remote filename, byte ranges (start_offset, end_offset), and cache type (in-memory or on-disk)
  + `cache_httpfs_cache_access_info_query()` - Returns cache access statistics including cache hit/miss counts, bytes read, and bytes cached for different cache entities (data, metadata, file handles, glob)
- 100% Compatibility with duckdb `httpfs`
  + Extension is built upon `httpfs` extension and automatically load it beforehand, so it's fully compatible with it; we provide option `SET cache_httpfs_type='noop'; SET enable_external_file_cache=true;` to fallback to and behave exactly as httpfs.
- Interaction with duckdb internal "external file cache". Duckdb by default enables external file cache, to avoid double caching cache_httpfs extension by default disable external file cache, which could be re-enabled by `SET enable_external_file_cache=true;`.
- Able to wrap **ALL** duckdb-compatible filesystem with one simple SQL `SELECT cache_httpfs_wrap_cache_filesystem(<your-fs>)`, and get all the benefit of caching, parallel read, IO performance stats, you name it.

Caveat:
- The extension is implemented for object storage, which is expected to be read-heavy workload and (mostly) immutable, so it only supports read cache (at the moment), cache won't be cleared on write operation for the same object.
  + We provide workaround for overwrite -- user could call `cache_httpfs_clear_cache` to delete all cache content, and `cache_httpfs_clear_cache_for_file` for a certain object.
  + All types of cache provides eventual consistency guarantee, which gets evicted after a tunable timeout.
- Filesystem requests are split into multiple sub-requests and aligned with block size for parallel IO requests and cache efficiency, so for small requests (i.e. read 1 byte) could suffer read amplification.
  A workaround for reducing amplification is to tune down block size via `cache_httpfs_cache_block_size` or fallback to native httpfs.

## Example usage
```sql
-- No need to load httpfs.
D LOAD cache_httpfs;
-- Create S3 secret to access objects.
D CREATE SECRET my_secret (      TYPE S3,      KEY_ID '<key>',      SECRET '<secret>',      REGION 'us-east-1',      ENDPOINT 's3express-use1-az6.us-east-1.amazonaws.com');
┌─────────┐
│ Success │
│ boolean │
├─────────┤
│ true    │
└─────────┘

-- Set cache type to in-memory.
D SET cache_httpfs_type='in_mem';

-- Access remote file.
D SELECT * FROM 's3://s3-bucket-user-2skzy8zuigonczyfiofztl0zbug--use1-az6--x-s3/t.parquet';
┌───────┬───────┐

## Comparison with other available caching options

| **Feature** | **cache_httpfs** | **QuackStore** | **DuckDB External File Cache** |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| **Persistence** | Supports both in-memory and on-disk, by default on-disk, also provides multi-disk support | On-disk | In-memory |
| **Cache granularity** | Tunable block size, 1MiB by default | 1 MB aligned blocks | Arbitrary byte ranges |
| **Activation** | Automatic | Explicit `quackstore://` prefix | Automatic |
| **Cache invalidation** | No support, on the roadmap | Optional (mtime + size) | Always validates (mtime, ETag for HTTP) |
| **Explicit cache eviction**| Yes | Yes | Yes | 
| **Data integrity** | No support, on the roadmap | Checksum validation + auto-recovery | ETag/version checking |
| **Eviction policy** | LRU (default) or W-TinyLFU for in-memory cache, LRU or deadline-based eviction for on-disk | LRU with configurable size limit | LRU (memory-based) |
| **Observability** | Provides cache access stats | No | No |

## Development

For development, the extension requires [CMake](https://cmake.org), and a `C++14` compliant compiler. Run `make` in the root directory to compile the sources. For development, use `make debug` to build a non-optimized debug version. You should run `make unit`.
